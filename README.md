The **Energy Consumption Forecasting** project aims to predict future energy usage using deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. By analyzing historical time-series data, the model learns consumption patterns and trends, enabling accurate short-term forecasts. The project is implemented using Python and key libraries such as TensorFlow, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. It includes comprehensive preprocessing steps like normalization and sequence generation for supervised learning. The results are evaluated using error metrics and visual plots that compare predicted values with actual consumption. This solution can help in optimizing energy distribution, planning, and reducing operational inefficiencies. The project is modular, extendable, and a strong foundation for deploying predictive models in real-world energy management systems.
